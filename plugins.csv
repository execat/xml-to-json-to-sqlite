1 The last note of the selection gets missed out. - FIXED, thanks to Jojo-Schmitz<br />
2 It only writes the output score in 4/4 time.<br />
3 The first stave of the output score plays in the same instrument as the source score but the second stave is in some generic squeaky instrument.</p>
<p>Workarounds -<br />
1 FIXED<br />
2 Any time signature with less than four quarters or equivalent to the bar will still generate all the notes and you can copy and paste them. Time signatures such as 5/4, 12/8 will lose notes and you might want to copy the notes first to a "blank" bit of 4/4, extract the voices and then do some tidying up.<br />

"Note Names","http://musescore.org/en/project/notenames","<p>This Plugin is derived from the <a class="freelinking external" href="http://musescore.org/en/handbook/plugins#notenames">Note Names plugin</a>.<br />
It adds the note names of the chords (not just the top note) in all voices (not just voice 1) of either the entire current score (not just the top staff) or on the selected measures/staves as staff text (above the staff for voice 1 and 3, below for voice 2 and 4) and uses note names according to the locale MuseScore is configured for (instead of just the English note names C, D, E, F, G, A, B).<br />
So the output changes with the setting of Menu -&gt; Edit -&gt; Preferences... -&gt; General -&gt; Language, or, if that is set to 'System', the output depends on the language setting of your PC.<br />
As a further extensions it also names notes with sharps, double sharps and double flats and the notename moves aside a bit, if the note would otherwise collide (in treble clef and voice 1 only).</p>
<p>Available locales: English, German, Dutch, Japanese, Italian, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian, Romainan, Danish, Norwegian, Swedish, Polish, Slovak, Czech and Greek.</p>
<p>The double sharp and double flat notes as well as Fb, Cb, E# and B# still need translation into French, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian, Romanian and Greek, help is more than welcome.</p>
<p>If you also want it to show courtesy- and microtonal accidentals, change 'false' to 'true' in the plugin code. Note however, that none of these have yet been translated, and their 'clear text' names can be rather long (e.g. "mirrored-flat-slash").</p>
<p>To use the plugin, you must first install it according to the <a class="freelinking external" href="http://musescore.org/en/handbook/plugins">instructions in the Handbook</a></p>
<p>The idea for this plugin stems from a <a class="freelinking external" href="http://musescore.org/en/node/16786">discussion in the forum</a>, the microtonal extension from <a class="freelinking external" href="http://musescore.org/en/node/16870">another discussion in the forum</a> </p>

"Check Harmony Rules","http://musescore.org/en/project/harmonyrules","<p>Check Harmony Rules - check Soprano, Alto, Tennor, Bass for conformance to good harmony writing rules.</p>
<h3> Installation instructions: </h3>
<ol>
<li>
 Download the plugin from here: <a href="https://github.com/c3yvonne7/harmonyRules/zipball/master" title="https://github.com/c3yvonne7/harmonyRules/zipball/master">https://github.com/c3yvonne7/harmonyRules/zipball/master</a>
</li>
<li>
Unzip the .zip file and save the .js file in the plugins directory of MuseScore. On Windows it's c:\Program Files\MuseScore\plugins
</li>
<li>
Restart or start MuseScore
</li>
</ol>
<h3> Current feature list: </h3>
<p>Checks are based on pp. 5, 6 &amp; 7 of the textbook, "First Year Harmony," by William Lovelock.  Note: This plugin does NOT check whether the leading note rises to tonic in the progression V-I (p.6, 11.f).  The other checks on these pages, 11.a to 11.e, 11.g, 12.a &amp; 12.b are checked.</p>
<h4> Multi-voice Checks: </h4>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Checks for parallel perfect 5ths and octaves, including consecutive 5ths and octaves in contrary motion, and unison to octave and octave to unison. (Note: different intervals that are enharmonically equivalent to a perfect 5th or octave are NOT detected).
</li>
<li>
<p>Checks for exposed 5ths and octaves.  Note: an exposed 5th between II and V is allowed by Lovelock's textbook, but this plugin will still mark it as a problem.  It is up to the composer to recognize such exposed 5ths as being acceptable.
</li>
</ol>
<h4> Single-voice Checks: </h4>
<p> The following errors are detected for each voice selected (or all voices if nothing was selected):</p>
<ol>
<li>
All augmented intervals between one note and the next
</li>
<li>
Diminished 5ths, when they are not followed by a note within the interval
</li>
<li>
Leaps of a diminished 4th and 7th (if you, unlike me, are not a novice composer, you may know how to use these intervals correctly; use your discretion).
</li>
<li>
Leaps of a 6th are better avoided, but should be followed by a note within the interval
</li>
<li>
Octaves, when they are not preceeded and followed by a note within the interval
</li>
<li>
Leaps of a 7th, 9th or larger, even with one note intervening
</li>
<p>Text is written to the score above any such intervals detected to notify the user of their existence, and the notes themselves are changed to red colour.  Using the undo button will easily undo all changes.</p>
<p>Currently, there are no plans to add any further checks.</p>
<h3> Assumptions made about the score: </h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Each voice should only have one note at a time (i.e. one note per museScore "chord"). If a voice contains a chord of two or more notes, it is annotated as an error on the score.</p>
<p>To check your chords properly, each voice should play only one note at a time, as only the  top note of each museScore chord in a single voice is checked.
</li>
<li>
<p>If there is a selection, only the selected notes are checked.  If nothing is selected, the entire score is checked.
</li>
<li>
<p>Any number of voices may be checked at once, but if there are more than four voices, consecutive  octaves may be more likely.
</li>
<li>
<p>For the purposes of MULTI-VOICE analysis, if different voices contain simultaneous notes of different lengths, the longer note(s) are treated as if they were split into shorter notes of the same length as the shortest simultaneous note.  No notes on the score itself are changed (apart from the colour of the notes).
</li>
<li>
<p>For the purposes of analysis for the SINGLE-VOICE checks, no notes are split. Consecutive notes of the same pitch ARE TREATED AS ONE NOTE for the analysis (the score itself is not changed).  I am only a novice composer. If you think consecutive notes of the same pitch should not be treated as one, please raise this as an issue.</p>

"Convert a natural minor key to either harmonic or melodic","http://musescore.org/en/project/minorvariations","<p>This plugin enables you to convert a natural minor key to either a harmonic or melodic minor key. You can also colour the affected notes to red with or without changing them. Also you can change the harmonic/melodic back to natural and/or the colour of the notes back to black.</p>
<p>First select the measures to be converted (if no selection is made then the whole of the score is assumed).<br />
Select the Minor Variations plugin and a window will pop up.<br />
The key signature shown will be the one for the score, or if more than one key is in use or a user defined one, this will be set to 'a minor'. This can be changed.<br />
You choose one of the following conversions:<br />
  Harmonic - natural to harmonic (raise the natural 7th by a half note).<br />
  Melodic - natural to melodic (raise the natural 6th and 7th when notes ascending).<br />
  Remove Harmonic - harmonic to natural (lower the harmonic 7th).<br />
  Remove Melodic - melodic to natural (lower the melodic 6th and 7th when notes ascending).<br />
You can choose one of the following actions on all the affected notes:<br />
  Mark as red (do not change the pitch of the note).<br />
  Mark as black (do not change the pitch of the note).<br />
  Mark as red (change the pitch of the note).<br />
  Mark as black (change the pitch of the note).<br />
So you can see the changes before making them and revert back to the original notes and note colour.<br />
Note. Only notes in the first voice are processed.<br />

"iRealb - A plugin to convert a MusicXML file into a iRealb chart","http://musescore.org/en/project/irealb","<p>iRealb - A plugin to convert a MuseScore MusicXML file into a iRealb chart.</p>
<p><b>What:</b><br />
      This plugin attempts to convert a MuseScore MusicXML file<br />
      into a iRealb chart.</p>
<p><b>How:</b><br />
      1.  Open MuseScore<br />
      2.  Create a regular MuseScore chart<br />
      3.  Save your MuseScore chart as a MusicXML file.<br />
      4.  Go to Plugins -&gt; iRealb<br />
      5.  Select the XML file of you chart.<br />
      6.  'Select All' -&gt; Copy the URI from the Text Dialog window.<br />
          (NOTE: the text dialog window is editable, which is handy for<br />
                 quick edits/changes once you get familiar with the<br />
                 iRealb syntax.)<br />
      7.  Open a Web Browser and navigate to <a href="http://www.irealb.com/editor/" title="http://www.irealb.com/editor/">http://www.irealb.com/editor/</a><br />
      8.  Paste the URI from above in the textarea titled:<br />
          'IMPORT - Paste a song/playlist code here:'<br />
      9.  Click 'Import'<br />
      10. Compare the Web Editor results with your MuseScore Chart<br />
      11. Make the corrections needed via the iRealb Web Editor<br />
          (there will probably be many ;)<br />
      12. Export your song (Email, etc) from the iRealb Web Editor<br />
          to get it on your iRealb app.</p>
<p>      NOTE: It does not convert every (any ;) chart accurately.<br />
            It does often get many of the chords and form correct.<br />
            usually, at the worst, it can save you time creating<br />
            your chart via the Web Editor.</p>
<p><b>Install:</b><br />
      1. Download the plugin by right clicking the link and save target as.<br />
      2. Uncompress the file (Unzip)<br />
      3. Place the unzipped dir, 'irealb' into the plugins directory of<br />
         MuseScore.</p>
<p>          Windows:<br />
                   C:\Program Files\MuseScore\plugins</p>
<p>          Linux (Ubuntu):<br />
                   /usr/share/mscore-{VERSION}/plugins<br />
                   i.e. /usr/share/mscore-1.1/plugins</p>
<p>          MacOSX: not sure</p>
<p>      4. Restart or start MuseScore</p>
<p><b>Version:</b><br />
Current Version is 0.1</p>
<p> NOTE: Tested against MuseScore 1.1 only!<br />
 This plugin may or may not work on versions != 1.1</p>
<p><b>Misc:</b></p>
<p>Bug reports, Fixes, Comments and Suggestions welcome!</p>
<p>Code is on github, feel free to Review/Fork.<br />

"Batch Export","http://musescore.org/en/project/batchexport","<p>This plugin will go through a specified folder and in its default settings exports PDF versions of all ".mscz" files for which no up-to-date version already exists. To use the plugin, you must first install it according to the <a class="freelinking external" href="http://musescore.org/en/handbook/plugins">instructions in the Handbook</a>, then:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select "Batch Export" from the Plugins menu</li>
<li>Select the in- and output format(s), or just use the default (*.mscz to *.pdf)</li>
<li>Decide whether or nor you want to also work on subdirectories of the one ye'll select in the next step and check/uncheck the corresponding box</li>
<li>Browse to the folder containing the files you wish to export</li>
<li>Select "Choose"</li>
<li>Confirm the dialog box that shows which files have been converted</li>
</ol>
<p>A couple of notes to be aware of:</p>
<ul>
<li>You may need to have a score already open in order for the Plugins menu to be active. Fixed in MuseScore 2.0+</li>
<li>The scores for which files were exported may be left open in tabs. If so, you'd need to close them manually. Fixed with MuseScore 1.2+</li>
<li>These open tabs will be labeled "untitled". Fixed in MuseScore 2.0+ and not an issue anymore with MuseScore 1.2+</li>
</ul>
<p>These issues are fixed with the above mentioned versions, and without re-installing the plugin.</p>
<p>This plugin now comes with translations of the dialogs into German, French (thanks to lasconic) and Spanish (thanks to jorgk), for all other language settings in MuseScore, it remains English. More translations are welcome, just contact us for including them.</p>
<p>The idea for this plugin stems from a <a class="freelinking external" href="http://musescore.org/en/node/12452">question in the forum</a>.</p>

"Crescendo or Diminuendo Note Velocities","http://musescore.org/en/project/crescendo-diminuendo-playback","<p>Sets velocity values for crescendos and diminuendos. To use, you must set the velocity value of the first and last notes, either manually by right clicking on the note and going to properties, or the preferred way, but simply using one of the dynamic markings such as Pianissimo, Forte, Mezzoforte, etc. Select the notes from FIRST to LAST, then just click on the plugin and it will automatically set the velocity values. The only velocity values that are important are the first and last, the ones in between will automatically be changed regardless of current value. It can go either way, set the first note louder, and the last note more quiet, or vice versa, and it will automatically increment the velocities up or down accordingly.</p>
<ul>
<li>V0.1 - First version.</li>
<li>V0.2 - I just made some bug fixes, it should now work flawlessly (hopefully at least).</li>
<li>V0.3 - Added dialog to inform user if their MuseScore version is less than version 1.1.</li>
<li>V0.4 - Simplified code, fixed two bugs and one potential problem with 2.0+.</li>
<li>V0.5 - Now it works on all (up to 4) voices in the selection.</li>
<li>V0.6 - Now it works on all selected staves.</li>
<li>V0.7 - Changes to score can now be undone, move to <a href="https://github.com/Jojo-Schmitz/crescendo-diminuendo-playback">GitHub</a>.</li>
<li>V0.8 - add option to color the notes the plugin worked on (see below).</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Jojo-Schmitz/crescendo-diminuendo-playback/zipball/master">Download</a></p>
<p>To enable the coloring of notes the plugin worked on, change the plugin code:</p>
<pre class="brush:js">
// Set to true, if you want this plugin to color all notes blue it changed 
// velocity on. Use the blacknotes plugin to turn them black as needed
var colorit = false;

<p>"Shape notes are a music notation designed to facilitate congregational and community singing. The notation, introduced in 1801, became a popular teaching device in American singing schools. Shapes were added to the note heads in written music to help singers find pitches within major and minor scales without the use of more complex information found in key signatures on the staff." (source <a class="freelinking external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shape_note">Wikipedia</a>)</p>
<p>There are two systems of shape notes. The plugin supports both systems.</p>

"Slash Notation Styles","http://musescore.org/en/project/slash","<p>The "Slash Notation Styles" plugin simplifies the process of creating the various styles of slash notation used in jazz. Ordinary slash notation is where measures are filled with one-per-beat slashes to indicate that they are open for improvisation or comping. Rhythmic notation is where slashes with stems, flags, and/or beams are used to indicate a specific comping rhythm. Accent notation is similar to rhythmic notation, but the notes are reduced in size and placed above the staff with stems pointing up, thus allowing you to show both the melody and the comping rhythm on the same staff (in different voices).</p>
<p>This plugin requires MuseScore 1.1 or later.</p>
<p>Regardless of which style you wish to use in a given passage, you start by selecting the measures you wish to affect, and then you run the plugin. A dialog box appears to allow you to select which style to use, which voice to apply it to, and other parameters. For rhythmic and accent notation, you should have already entered ordinary notes representing the rhythm to be used; the plugin will move these notes to the appropriate location on the staff and turn them into slashes. For slash notation, any current content in the selected voice is deleted and replaced by one-per-beat slashes. All slashes created by the plugin are set to zero velocity (volume) so that they do not affect playback.</p>
<p>A description of the dialog box:</p>
<p>Clef: Select which clef is active for the selection. You need to specify this so the plugin can place the slashes on the proper line or space.</p>
<p>Style: Slash, Rhythmic, or Accent, as described above.</p>
<p>Duration: For slash notation, specify the duration of the slashes in <a class="freelinking external" href="http://musescore.org/en/plugin-development/tick-length-values">tick values</a>. The default of 480 will produce quarter note (crotchets) slashes. In 6/8 time, you will probably prefer either 240 to produce eighth note (quaver) slashes, or 720 to produce dotted quarter note (dotted crotchet) slashes.</p>
<p>Voice: Select which voice should be replaced with slashes.</p>
<p>Pitch: Select, by MIDI value, which line or space is used for the slashes. Normally this is set for you based on your Clef and Style selection, but you can override this if necessary.</p>

"Explode / Implode","http://musescore.org/en/project/plode","<p>The "Explode" plugin takes a series of chords containing a fixed number of notes and splits those chords up into the same number of individual staves, each containing one note at a time.  This can be useful when writing for a section of a band or orchestra.  In passages where all parts share the same rhythm, you can write the whole passage on one staff in one voice, then run the plugin to split this into separate staves.</p>
<p>The "Implode" plugin performs the opposite function: it takes staves containing lines with identical rhythms and combines them all into chords on one staff.</p>
<p>To use the "Explode" plugin, the staves must be contiguous, and you have to manually copy the whole series of chords onto each staff.  Then you can select the whole passage (all staves) and run the plugin.  You will be left with staves containing just one note at a time each, with the notes assigned to staves from top down.</p>
<p>To use the "Implode" plugin, the staves must be contiguous as well.  Select the passage (all staves) and run the plugin.  The contents of the lower selected staves will be collected into chords on the top selected staff.  The lower staves will be left unchanged.</p>

"Tune notes for playback with micro tonal intervals","http://musescore.org/en/project/autotuneselection","<p>This plugin allows you to edit note pitches from a selection.</p>
<p><strong>How it works ?</strong></p>
<p>1- First of all, create a score and enter notes without thinking about the sound.<br />
2- Select the zone (measures, on one staff, on more staves, ....) you want the pitch will be changed<br />
3- click on Plugins &gt; Auto Tune Selection<br />
4- In the dialog window that just opened, enter the value you want for every notes you want to change the pitch<br />
5- click ok<br />
6- click on play, you should now ear the sound with the value you've enterred.</p>
<p><strong> Example</strong><br />
I've created a score with micro-tonal notes.</p>
<p>About the displaying :<br />
1- I create the score<br />
2- I enter the notes (with natural notes, and without thinking about the sound)<br />
3- I use the custom key dialog (hit the k key to do that) and create a custom key with a B flat a E flat and a  G half sharp (using the sharp symbol with a down arrow)<br />
4- apply the custom key signature to the score (by drag n drop)</p>
<p>About playback and sounds :<br />
5- now select the zone into the score (I say a zone which means it can be a staff or futher staves or just some measures)<br />
6- click on Plugins &gt; Auto Tune Selection<br />
7- Enter the value -100 under the B (to have a Bb) enter the value -100 under the E (to have a Eb) and then, enter the value -50 under the G (to have a half sharp G) then click ok to validate.<br />
8- Click on play and enjoy the right pitch !</p>
<p><strong>What this plugin is NOT</strong><br />
This plugin can't change note displaying. It only affects playback and note sounds !</p>
